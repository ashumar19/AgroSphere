# **AgroSphere**  

### **Project Overview**  
*AgroSphere* is an AI-powered platform designed to transform traditional farming practices. By leveraging machine learning, satellite imagery, and climate analytics, AgroSphere provides farmers with personalized recommendations on crop selection, farming techniques, and sustainable practices. It empowers farmers to make data-driven decisions, improving yield, efficiency, and climate resilience.

### **Key Features**  

1. **Personalized Farmer Profiling**  
   - Tailored farming strategies based on individual farmer data such as land size, historical yields, and available resources.  

2. **Dynamic Climate Adaptation Planning**  
   - Forecasts weather patterns and multi-season scenarios to provide multi-year crop rotation plans for maximizing sustainability.  

3. **AI-Powered Soil and Crop Health Analyzer**  
   - Analyzes satellite imagery to monitor crop health and soil conditions. Provides insights such as early crop stress detection and irrigation scheduling.  

4. **Collaborative Community Ecosystem**  
   - Connects farmers through a support network to share best practices, seek advice, and form cooperatives.  

5. **Policy and Subsidy Integration**  
   - Real-time updates on government schemes and subsidies related to climate-resilient farming.  

6. **Disease and Yield Analysis**  
   - Image upload for disease detection and soil report upload for yield analysis. Provides detailed insights and solutions.  

7. **User-Friendly Interface**  
   - Simple navigation through pages like Home, About Us, Contact Us, and Community.

### **How It Works**  

1. **Home Page**  
   - Displays a welcome message with a time-based greeting (e.g., "Good Morning" or "Good Evening").  
   - Login button directs users to the login page.  

2. **Farmer Profile Page**  
   - Collects details: name, age, gender, profile photo, mobile number, location (via GPS), and farming type (dropdown menu).  

3. **Dashboard**  
   - Displays personalized greeting and profile picture.  
   - Options for different farming methods: Subsistence, Commercial, Plantation, Mixed, Intensive, and Organic Farming, each with a representative image.  

4. **Farming Method Details**  
   - Selecting a method displays a brief description, along with Disease and Yield buttons:  
     - **Disease**: Upload an image for disease detection and solution based on dataset matching.  
     - **Yield**: Upload a soil test report to analyze and fetch details from Wikipedia.  

5. **Community Page**  
   - Direct link to [WhatsApp Community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/H7b5CgtK0sfHriEN1Km1cW).
